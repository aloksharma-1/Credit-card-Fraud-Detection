# Credit-card-Fraud-Detection
Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection project repository! This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The project is implemented using a Jupyter Notebook and involves various steps including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, and evaluation.
## Project Overview
Credit card fraud is a serious concern in the financial industry, causing significant financial losses for both individuals and companies. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can effectively identify fraudulent transactions and minimize the impact of fraud.

**The main components of this project are:**
1.**Data Preprocessing:** The raw credit card transaction data is processed and cleaned to prepare it for analysis. This step involves handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

2.**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In this phase, the data is visualized and analyzed to gain insights into the distribution of features, transaction patterns, and potential correlations between variables. EDA helps in understanding the data and identifying any outliers or anomalies.

3.**Model Development:** Machine learning algorithms are applied to create a predictive model. Both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques can be explored for this purpose. Commonly used algorithms include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.

4.**Model Evaluation:** The developed model is evaluated using appropriate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves. It's important to select metrics that are suitable for imbalanced datasets where the number of fraudulent transactions is significantly lower than legitimate ones.

5.**Deployment:** Depending on the project's requirements, the trained model can be deployed in various ways. This could involve integration into a real-time credit card processing system or creating an API for fraud detection.
